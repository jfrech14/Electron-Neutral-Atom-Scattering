This is for running the code on clusters enabled with MPI. The partial wave output has been removed from the code since 
it wasn't all that useful except for checking results. The only requirement is that the number of Energies to calculate 
be an integer multiple of the number of tasks you assign to MPI. This requirement simplified the conversion from OpenMP.
